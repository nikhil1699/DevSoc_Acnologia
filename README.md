Project Name: !Addict==Happy
Inspiration: Current generation is addicted to a vast range of things/substances ranging from problems as meek as a Smartphone and 
applications in it, going all the way up to highly dangerous drugs, From various bad habits to some 'tough productive' but addicting 
activities. These addictions are sometimes very harmful effecting victims physical, mental and social conditions. Many people do try 
to get rid of those habits but are unable to. Some people don't have access to the required information whereas some just don't have 
enough motivation, These situations are responsible for the further downfall and a feeling of helplessness.

We are motivated to provide those people with a platform where they can actually get rid of their problems. But unlike few others who 
tried this, we have devised a very systematic approach to solve that issue, We went through various blogs, SubReddits to various medical 
documents to identify a most efficient way to solve the problem.

Specifications: 1) The first step after registration should be to classify people in various categories or 'AdGroups' as we will call it. 
And people with common problems should come together, If everyone with different problems is at a single location, it becomes quite 
chaotic. 2) Live conferencing feature where people can directly contact the specialist or Ex-Addicts and ask them about their problems. 
3) Finding Doctors and Experts for a particular problem and assigning them to their respective AdGroups. They will be made in-charge/admin 
of that group. 4) Real-time chatting 5) Admins can share relevant videos, images and other related medical materials. 6) Blog system. 
Blogs by those who experienced these problems in past and how they overcame them 7) Displaying information about live events across the 
country.

This is a big project and we will be developing it even after the hackathon. We would be needing to verify expert credibility and 
certifications, Verification of content through an AI moderator, Extending this to mobile applications and many more such features 
can be added.
